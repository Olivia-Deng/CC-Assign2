the shout outs to their dad, but track 13 states, \\\\\"hey dad, i'm writing to you, not to tell you that i still hate you...\\\\\"  This whole CD has a slightly deeper, darker theme than their debut album, but overall there's an undertone of maturity that made me proud of the boys.<br />My Bloody Valentine left me creeped out (\\\\\"i ripped out his throat\\\\\"), the Young and Hopeless made me

all the lyrics on the whole album!One of my favorite songs is Emotionless.It is talkin about their dad who left when they were only 16 and i can relate to that song alot.I really feel that this cd is

it's their best Cd to date.\n8 closest neighbor: \nreview_id: R35FVRK5IY8XW\nsentence: The Young and Hopeless is also one of my favourites, I think gets the point across that GC don't give a damn what
